# DIADRASTIKO
A proof of concept / prototype for "In-Video" editing of coding tutorials.
Any tutorial captured using the interface provided can be made available for the user to pause-play, seek and edit at any time during video playback seamlessly. 

Note: Video does not mean literal MP4 or video format, but in essence a vdeo-like audio visual experience.
